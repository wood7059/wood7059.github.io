            <p>  
            I grew up fishing on Potato Lake at my families cabin. The love for it revived in the past 5 years
            with ice fishing. Ever since then I've purchased a boat and invested way to much into my tackle box.
            I like fishing for pike and muskie although anything that bites is a good fish in my book

                During my time in the Boy Scouts, I found myself at an archery range at a lot of the camps I 
                visited. This year I've been practicing with a compound bow for my first hunt this fall

                One of the main reasons why I joined the Navy was to travel. during my 6 years of service
                I visited Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, South Korea, The Phillipines, Germany, France, Japan, and Belgium.

                Some of my most fond memories growing up were at classic car shows. My whole life I've been around old
                cars and one day I will own one of my own.
