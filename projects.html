                In a data structures course we had an assingment to created and organized threaded map that searches
                at 0(n). The items in each node is a key and some sort of value which could be a character, string, or 
                object. This algorithm is effective at storing data that has a good runtime when creating new   
                data fields, searching for existing data fields, or deleting data fields.

                <p>  
                I'm currently working on a 51' ford business coupe. It will hopefully be on the road some day
                but the build process has put me in the position to learn a lot of new skills. It is currently
                in the metal work phase so it is far from complete. The picture on the left is where I would like  
                to see it some day.

                <p>  
                While working in the Navy I set up vCenter to show the overall health of our datacenter and had over hundreds of physical servers 
                and hundreds of virtual servers. For this project I also mounted TV's and routed cables through the office so members in the division
                could more efficiently and accuretly respond to technical issues in the datacenter.
